# Power-bi-phonepe-project

<H1>Overview</H1>
This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of hypothetical PhonePe-like transactional and user data using Microsoft Power BI. The goal is to transform raw, disparate data from various services (Recharge, Money Transfer, Loans, Insurance) into a cohesive and interactive business intelligence dashboard. This dashboard provides key performance indicators (KPIs) and actionable insights into user behavior, service performance, and financial trends.
