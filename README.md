# Power-bi-phonepe-project

<H1>Overview</H1>
This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of hypothetical PhonePe-like transactional and user data using Microsoft Power BI. The goal is to transform raw, disparate data from various services (Recharge, Money Transfer, Loans, Insurance) into a cohesive and interactive business intelligence dashboard. This dashboard provides key performance indicators (KPIs) and actionable insights into user behavior, service performance, and financial trends.

<H1>Objectives</H1>
- The primary objectives of this Power BI project are to:

- Develop a Robust Data Model: Create a scalable and efficient Star Schema within Power BI to link user demographics with various transaction types.

- Calculate Key Metrics: Use DAX to calculate essential financial and operational KPIs (e.g., Total Transaction Value, Transaction Count, Success Rate, Average Transaction Value, Monthly Active Users).

- Identify Service Performance: Analyze the performance, volume, and growth rates of different PhonePe services (e.g., Money Transfer vs. Loans vs. Insurance).

- Visualize User Behavior: Gain insights into how different user segments (e.g., age groups, joining date cohorts) interact with the application.

- Enable Data-Driven Decisions: Provide an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to quickly identify trends, bottlenecks, and areas for strategic focus.
